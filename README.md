# Bug-Tracking-System
The Bug Tracking System is a project of mine that was made to document bugs/issues I come across during the developement of any personal/academic projects. From command line, you may file new text files which formats data pertaining to the information of the bug/issue at hand where the programmer may come back to and update the status should they desire.
