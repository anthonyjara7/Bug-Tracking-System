BUG PRIORITY:		low
BUG DESCRIPTION: 	When the filewriter came to writing out the bug description 
			during the process of filing a new bug, it would print the entirety 
			of the input on a single line. Seeing as how this may be lacking 
			in readability, I tried to print out the input on multiple 
			lines. After failing to put the right amount of tabs in and newlines 
			along with just getting the thing to work, I finally found the fix 
			just for it and now it should even print this out properly. 

BUG STATUS: 		FIXED
